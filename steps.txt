1. Create the api folder: node-api
2. Inside the node-api, run the command: npm -init -y
3. The command in step 2 creates the package.json, which stores the dependencies of the application
4. Install Express: npm install express

Express microframework to deal with routes and views: 
    - Routes: URL address that the user can access;
    - Views: The views haha (not gonna be used by the API).

6. Install Nodemon to run live updates on the files: npm install -D nodemon 
    add the script ("dev" : "nodemon server.js" ) to the package.json file
7. To run the script use: npm run dev
